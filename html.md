# HTML and CSS Notes


### Positions in CSS

1. **Static**: This is basically the default. It is in normal document flow and not affected by top, bottom, left, or right[^1] attributes.
2. **Relative**: Here it is exactly like static with a major difference: *It is affected by the tblr attributes.
3. **Absolute**: Relative to nearest positioned ancestor or root.
4. **Fixed**: Relative to the viewport.
5. **Sticky**: Combination of fixed and relative. Very useful in fixing headers while scrolling.

[^1]: I will refer to it as tblr from now on for simplicity.
