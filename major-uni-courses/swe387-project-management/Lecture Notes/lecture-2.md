## Objectives

1. Describe the importance of aligning projects with business strategy, the strategic planning process, and using a SWOT analysis.
2. Explain two different approaches to the project planning process—a predictive approach and an agile approach—and compare the roles of product managers versus program or project managers.
3. Summarize the various methods for selecting projects and demonstrate how to calculate net present value, return on investment, payback, and the weighted score for a project.
4. Discuss the program selection process and approaches to creating programs.
5. Describe the project portfolio selection process using a traditional approach and a lean or agile approach.

## Aligning Projects with Business Strategy

Most organizations cannot undertake most of the potential projects identified because of resource limitations or other constraints. Hence, they need to select and prioritize from them.

The overall mission and **business strategy** guide this selection process.

### Strategic Planning

Determining long-term objectives by
    1. analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of an organization
    2. studying opportunities and threats in business environment
    3. predicting future trends
    4. projecting the need for new products and services

Most organizations have theirs written. It usually includes mission, vision, and goals for the next 3-5 years.

### SWOT Analysis

Analyzing strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
It aids in strategic planning and helps ensure that projects' ideas are tied to organizations's strategic plan.
Some like to preform it by using **mind mapping**.

## Traditional & Agile Approaches to Project Planning

Many organizations follow a traditional approach, often in four stages.
Others follow agile to make more timely decisions. Others use a combination (hybrid).

### Traditional Project Planning Process

It is hierarchical. It is very important to start at the top of the pyramid to select projects that support the business strategy.

Four Stages:

1. Strategic Planning
2. Business area analysis
3. Project Planning
4. Resource Allocation

Problems:

1. Capacity does not meet demand.
2. Spending is irresponsible. (annual)
3. Difficult to pivot quickly and make fast investment decisions.

### Agile Project Planning

Teams provide feedback to strategy. Quarterly Business Review (QBR) meetings are often held instead of annually.
The organization defines the strategic direction. The teams are funded and entrusted to figure out the best approach to define and deliver the greatest business value.

Strategy Implementation Circle

Strategy -> Objectives -> Projects -> Products ->Value -> Feedback -> Benefits (and cycle continues)

An important artifact is **product roadmap** which shows a high-level visual summary of vision and direction of products over time.

A **Gantt Chart** is a standard format for displaying project schedule information.

#### Difference between Product Manager and Program or Project Manager

- Product: Responsible for a product. (Why?)
- Program: Interdependency among projects, products, and other strategic initiatives (How? and When?)
- Project: usually under program managers, would work directly with customers/homeowners, suppliers, team members, and other stakeholders.

They all have the responsibility without authority. Product roadmaps and Gantt charts are tools that help them overcome the challenge of leading and timing.

#### Difference between Product Roadmap and a Gantt Chart

A roadmap sets a strategic plan and goals for completing a major undertaking. The defining elements of roadmaps are:

  1. They focus on high-level plans (not details)
  2. They communicate the strategic thinking and objectives behind the plans.

It defines the *why*.

The Gantt Chart defines the *how* and *when*.

Logically, the roadmap comes before the Gantt Chart.

## Methods for Selecting Projects

### Focusing on competitive strategy and broad organizational needs

    Competitive strategies, like cost or focus
    Broad org needs: Three important criteria (need, funding, and will)

### Performing net present value analysis or other financial projections

Three methods:
     - net present value (NPV) analysis
     - return on investment (ROI)
     - payback analysis

#### Net Present Value (NPV)

It considers the time value of money. As time passes, the value of money decreases.
If positive, the return exceeds the **opportunity cost of capital** – return available by investing somewhere else.

**Cash flow**: benefits - costs
NPV = discounted benefits - discounted costs

NPV also works for projects with different lengths.
The higher the NPV the better.
Some start from Year 0, others Year 1

To calculate it:
     1. Determine costs and benefits
     2. Determine discount rate (rate used in discounting future cash flows) / aka capitalization rate or opportunity cost
     3. Calculate NPV. In excel, npv(discount rate, range of cash flows).

$NPV = \sum_{t=0}^{n} \frac{A_t}{(1 + r)^t}$,
where $t$ equals the year, $n$ is last year of cash flow, $A_t$ amount of cash flow in year $t$, and $r$ is discount rate.
The fraction $\frac{1}{(1+r)^t}$ is called discount factor.

#### Return on Investment (ROI)

Subtract the costs from the benefits and divide the difference by the costs.
It is always a percentage.
The higher the better.
**Required Rate of Return**: minimum acceptable rate of ROI
**Internal Rate of Return**: what discount rate results in NPV of ZERO. (Excel -> Goal Seek function)

#### Payback Analysis

**Payback Period**: amount of time it takes to get back the total dollars invested in a project (Cost of project / annual cash flow).

The shorter the better.

### Using a weighted scoring model

A tool that provides a systematic process for selecting projects based on many criteria.
Each criterion is assigned a weight as how important it is.
Then, assign score as to how much a project meets this criteria.
Compare the weighted scores of the projects, and choose the one with the highest.

A spreadsheet allows you to change weights immediately and compare results.

Each organization should tailor this method to meet its needs and avoid bias in choosing.

### Implementing a balanced scorecard

Converts an organization's value drivers to a series of defined metrics.
It was invented to help choose projects that align with business strategy.
It balances traditional financial metrics with non-financial perspectives. (Financial, Customer, Internal Processes, and Learning & Growth)

### Addressing problems, opportunities, and directives

Problems: undesirable situations that prevent an organization from achieving goals. (current or anticipated)

Opportunities: chances to improve the organization.

Directives: new requirements or regulations imposed by management, government, or some external influence.

### Considering project time frame

Based on the time the project will take or date it needs to be done at.

For example, if there's a project that will never be done in the deadline, it should not even be considered.

Even if a project finishes very quickly, you need to consider other factors like financials and resources.

### Considering project priority

Some just assign priorities and do projects from the highest to lowest priority.

Of course, organizations usually use a combination of these methods.
