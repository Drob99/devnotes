## Notes

- The key idea is to organize programs into self contained objects.
- It is almost like having several mini programs.

> **Object orientation provides a direct mapping between concepts and code.**

### Object

- An object is simply a separate, self-contained, entity that could be identified and has attribute(s) and behavior(s).
- OBJECT = IDENTITY + ATTRIBUTES + BEHAVIOR
- Examples:
  - Apples: color of skin, ripeness measure, ...etc.
  - Telephone: color, technology, shape, calls people, ...etc.

### Class

- It is used to create objects.
- It describes what an object is.
- To build a house, builders use designs and build a specific house that follows that design. In a similar fashion, developers design classes and instantiate objects that utilize these classes.
- For example, a class *BankAccount* can contain the attributes and methods common in all bank accounts. When I create one for myself that belongs to me, it is an object of the *BankAccount* class.
