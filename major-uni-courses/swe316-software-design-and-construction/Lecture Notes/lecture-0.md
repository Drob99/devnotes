# Software Design & Construction (Lecture #0)

- In real life projects, it is normal to encounter a project with a lot of classes that may even reach to 100. 
- In this course, our goal is to create programs that, when visited later, could be explained, recognized, and built upon. This is referred to as **Maintainability**.
- Another important goal is to write components that could be reused as part to other projects, which we call **Reusability**.
- Basically, we study how the code could be improved. Our goal is not only to have a running code, as this is not actually an ultimate goal. You could have a running code that is horrible to read and difficult to maintain.
- **Design patterns** are ways of sharing the methods of solving problems done already by people before us. Here we don't reuse code but rather the way of solution, aka the design, itself.
- Dealing with requirements is never and will never be fun, but is actually a vital step to make your life easier in the design phase.
