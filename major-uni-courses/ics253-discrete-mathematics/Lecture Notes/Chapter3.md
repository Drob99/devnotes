## 3.1 Sets and Subsets

A collection of objects. Each object is an **element**.

A set can contain elements of different varieties.

Listing elements: **roster notation**.
Repetition and order has no meaning.

$\in$ is an element of a set
$\notin$
capital letters: sets, lower case: elements
**empty set**: set with no elements symboled with $\emptyset$ sometimes referred to as **null set** denoted as $\{ \}$.

A **finite set** is either empty or have elements that could be numbered 1 through n for some positive integer n.
An **infinite set** is one that is not finite.
The **cardinality** of a finite set $A$, denoted by $|A|$, is the number of distinct elements in $A$.
