### Brief Introduction

- Discrete mathematics is a branch of math that deals with discrete objects.
- Discrete objects are ones that could be counted. For example, the set of of integer numbers is a good example of a discrete object. We can say that 1 comes after 0 and before 2.
- However, continuous objects have no such distinctions. We do not know the exact number of real numbers between 0 and 1 because there are infinitely many.
- A digital clock visualizes time in a discrete way. You can easily recognize that 8:01 comes immediately after 8:00 in a digital clock that displays only hours and minutes.
- An analog clock visualizes time in a continuous way. The second hand is continuously moving. You can see time as continuously moving in front of you.
