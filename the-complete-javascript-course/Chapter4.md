# Chapter 4: Understanding DOM Manipulation & Event Handling

## Master the DOM

- The DOM is the interactive version of an html document.
- First step in making an element interactive is to target it.
- We can target using `getElementById` for a unique id or `querySelector` for things that repeat within a document.
- We can create html elements using javascript as well.
- The defer keyword in the script tag makes the document add all the html elements and styling them before adding the js file.
