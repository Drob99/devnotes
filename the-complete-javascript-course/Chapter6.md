# Chapter 6: Gain Competency with Asynchronous Programming

## Asynchronous JS with promises and async/await

- Synchronous is basically line by line, or sequential.
- Async is code that can't run in the same sequential order as everything else.
- Await is only usable inside async functions.
- Await is a way of handling promises.

- API, or application programming interface, is like a server endpoint, or a place we go to to get information.
- It is the means of communication with an endpoint.
- These requests are asynchronous.
