# Chapter 5: Modern OOP with Classes, Constructors, & Inheritance

## OOP Intro

- Functional programming Vs Object-oriented programming
- A class is a template for creating an object.
- Inheritance is when a new class inherits the template of a parent class.
- Instantiation is defining an object of a class.
- The benefit of getters and setters is that we can intercept and add extra logic before reading or updating the value.
- The `this` keyword refers to the current version of the instantiated class.
