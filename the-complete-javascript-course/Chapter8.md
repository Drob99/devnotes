# Chapter 8: Coding Best Practices & Algorithmic Programming

## Optimize JS for better performance and efficiency

1. Minimize DOM manipulations.
2. Efficient event listeners.
3. Optimize loops (break, continue).
4. Choose correct data structure (object / arrays).
5. Caching data.
6. Monitor performance.
7. Web APIs & Libraries (rule of least power).

## Applying coding best practices, and write clean and maintainable code

1. Make sure your variable names are always appropriate. You should be able to infer the variable meaning from the name.
2. Similarly for functions, use proper names. 
3. Every function needs to have ONE task.
4. Code commenting: By planning and preparing using comments, you make large problems become small steps and make things easier to understand later on.
5. Avoid convoluted statements, even if they look fancy.

## Big O notation

- A system that allows us to describe the complexity of a task.
- Performance is dependent on input size.
- $O(1) < O(log n) < O(n) < O(n^2)$


## Solving algorithmic programming questions with JS

- All the questions and solutions are provided on the Github repo. The list of questions are the following:
              1. Unique Characters in a string
              2. Merge two sorted arrays
              3. Find All Duplicates in an Array O(n) time
              4. Rotate Array by k steps
              5. Check Valid Parentheses
